1. Install Microsoft SQL Server Express 2022; Go with all the default settings
2. Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). 
3. Open up SSMS, you will be greeted with a window with connection details. 
If you went with the default settings during the sql server setup the server name should look like: <your-pc-name>\SQLEXPRESS
 and the authentication : `Windows Authentication`

Check `Trust server certificate` then click `Connect`.


4. On the left-side panel you will see a menu tree with <your-pc-name>\SQLEXPRESS at the root. Right click on the `Databases` item, 
choose `Restore Database`

5. In the new window, in the "Source" area choose the `Device` radio option, then tap on the `...` dots button.
+ A `Select backup devices` window will appear; 
    - make sure the media type is 'File' not 'URL', click on `Add`, 
    - navigate in the new explorer window that opens to the `DatabaseSnapshots`, select the `Corum_Total_DB.bak` file. 
    - click `OK` now in the `Select backup devices` window to close it 
+ The `Restore Database` window should now be populated with the info of that file. 
    - click 'OK' , you should see a confirmation window with this message: `Corum_Total_DB` restored succesfully.

+ Repeat this process for all the other remaining files. 
	- At the end you should have 4 databases: Corum_Total_DB, Corum0, Member, Log_Corum_0


6. Now go into the `Security` item -> right click on its `Logins` child -> `New login'
 + A `Login - New` window should open :
  	- for `Login name` type: `potato` 
	- then select `SQL Server authentication`, type in: `ahffk` for both password fields
             (Note: you can find these credentials hardcoded in the server source code too) 
	- Uncheck `Enforce password expiration` then click `OK`
	- now this `potato` user should appear in the list of users under the `Logins` item. 

7. Now open up (via the `+` next to it) the `Corum_Total_DB`
	- `Security` -> `Users`
	 - if you see a user `potato` there, double-click on it and delete it; it is probalby malformed and we have to re-create it
	- right click on `Users` -> `New User`
	- in the new window for `User Type` select `SQL user with login`
	- put `potato` in `User name`
	- in `Login name` click on the `...` button  
		- in the new `Select Login` window click `Browse`
		- in the new `Browse Objects` window scroll until you find the `potato` user and select it, confirm via `OK`
+ `potato` should now appear in the list of users now too; right click on it -> `Properties` -> `Membership`
	- check `db_datareader`, `db_datawriter`, `db_owner` ; confirm with `OK`

Repeat these steps for the other 3 remaining databases. 

8. Back in the left-side panel right click the server name (<your-pc-name>\SQLEXPRESS) 
  -> `Properties' -> `Security'
   -> under 'Server authentication' select the mixed authentication option (with both sql server and windows authentication)


Now open the `SQL Server 2022 Configuration Manager` app
 -> expand `SQL Server Network Configuration` -> `Protocols for SQLEXPRESS`
  -> right lick on `TCP/IP' -> ``Properties``

  - in the new window in the `Protocol` tab set `Enabled` to `Yes`
  - switch to `IP Addresses` tab; Put `Enabled` : `Yes` to every ip in there
  - in the last item, `IPAll` ::
	- on `TCP Dynamic Ports` delete everything in there, leave it blank
	- on `TCP Port` put 1433, `Apply`. 



For these changes to take effect SQL Server has to be restarted. You can do it either from the services management console
or by simply restarting your pc.

You can verify everything is ok by opening command prompt and executing this command:
`sqlcmd -S 127.0.0.1,1433 -U potato -P ahffk` ; if you do not encounter any error then all is properly set up. close the window or type 'exit' then hit enter
